# Dependencies
##  pyrosim: A python robot simulator. 

Pyrosim enables the creation of robots with arbitrary body plans
and neural controllers, and the optimization of them in arbitrary simulated
environments. Visit the [Documentation](https://mec-lab.github.io/pyrosim) for more detailed information.

## ParallelPy

ParallelPy allows for parallel execution of independent code across multiple computers.
It's primary purpose is to parallelize the physics simulations needed to preform evolutionary robotics experiments across a compute cluster.
